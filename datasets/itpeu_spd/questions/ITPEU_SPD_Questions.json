        "ITPEU_SPD_001": "Yes, your 28-year-old daughter is covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan if she is incapable of self-support because of a physical and/or developmental disability, and she depends on you for support. To maintain her eligibility as a covered family member, it's required that her incapacity began before she reached the age of 26 years. Additionally, you might need to provide proof of her incapacity to the Board of Trustees no later than 31 days after she reached the age limit, and proof of the continued existence of such incapacity may be required by the Board of Trustees from time to time​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_002": "Yes, treatment for lymphoma is covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan. Specifically, autologous (self-donor) bone marrow transplants with high doses of chemotherapy are considered eligible for coverage on a prior approval basis for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, intermediate or high grade Stage III or IVB, among other conditions. This includes, but is not limited to, medically appropriate transplants of certain organs or tissues and related medical expenses, as long as they meet the criteria established by the Plan.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_003": "Yes, flu vaccines are covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan. The plan pays 100% of the cost for \"Preventive Health Services\" required by the Affordable Care Act when such services are provided by Network Healthcare Providers. This includes immunizations for influenza (flu) for both children and adults as part of the preventive care services covered by the plan​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_004": "The ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan explicitly states that dialysis treatment is not included as a Covered Service under Home Health Care Services. Therefore, home dialysis treatment is not covered by your plan as per the exclusion list provided in the document. Additionally, the purchase or rental of dialysis equipment is also excluded from coverage​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_005": "If your work schedule is reduced in a way that lowers your Benefit Classification Level under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan (for example, from Level IV to Level III due to a decrease from 35 to 25 hours per week), you and your covered family members have the option, at your own expense, to maintain your medical, vision, dental, and prescription drug benefits at the level you had before the change in your work hours. This allows you to continue receiving the same level of benefits despite the reduction in hours, provided you pay the necessary contributions to maintain that level of coverage​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_006": "The ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan explicitly excludes treatment for Mental Health Disorders from its coverage, as indicated in Section 23, \"General Exclusions and Limitations\" of the Plan Document. Therefore, any charges for the treatment of a Mental Health Disorder are not covered under this plan​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_007": "If you visit the doctor, as a participant with a contribution rate of $3.35 per hour, you fall below the special rule threshold for participants in Class III and IV, which is set at a contribution rate of $3.75 per hour or higher. Therefore, the special co-pay rule does not apply to you. Here's what you'd generally be responsible for:\n\nDeductible: You'll be responsible for paying a deductible each calendar year. This deductible applies regardless of the number of injuries or illnesses you may have.\n\nFamily Maximum Deductibles: If applicable, there is a maximum of two deductibles per family per calendar year.\n\nCoverage for In-Network Expenses: After you've paid your deductible, the Fund will cover 70% of all covered medical expenses within the network, up to your Out Of Pocket Maximum or the annual Maximum Medical Benefit specified in the Schedule of Benefits. Once you've reached your Out Of Pocket Maximum and if you haven't reached your annual Maximum Medical Benefit, the Fund will cover 100% of the additional covered medical expenses.\n\nCoverage for Out-of-Network Expenses: For services out of the network, after your deductible, the Fund will cover 60% of all covered medical expenses, following the same rules regarding the Out Of Pocket Maximum and the Maximum Medical Benefit.\n\nParticipant's Responsibility: Aside from the deductible, you are responsible for paying 30% of In-Network covered medical expenses and 40% of Out-of-Network covered medical expenses, up until you reach your Out Of Pocket Maximum. Any expenses beyond the Maximum Medical Benefit for the year are your responsibility.\n\nMaximum Medical Benefit: This is the total amount the Fund will pay for your covered medical expenses, both In and Out of Network, per calendar year. It includes all benefits paid at 60%, 70%, and 100% rates.\n\nSince your contribution rate is $3.35/hr, for any doctor visit, you'd need to pay the deductible first. After that, for in-network services, you'd be responsible for 30% of the remaining costs until you reach your Out Of Pocket Maximum, at which point the plan would cover at 100% up to the Maximum Medical Benefit for the year. For out-of-network services, you would be responsible for 40% of the costs post-deductible until reaching the Out Of Pocket Maximum. The exact amounts for your deductible, Out Of Pocket Maximum, and Maximum Medical Benefit would be specified in your Schedule of Benefits, which should be referenced for detailed figures.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_008": "Dental Benefits:\n\nDeductible: You are responsible for paying a deductible amount per calendar year for dental expenses.\n\nCoverage: After the deductible, the plan pays 75% of the balance of any covered dental expense, except for prosthetics and teeth cleaning.\n\nProsthetics: The plan pays 45% of charges related to prosthetics after you have been continually eligible for benefits for twelve (12) consecutive months, up to the maximum dental benefit. You are entitled to benefits for one prosthetic appliance in any period of five (5) consecutive years.\n\nTeeth Cleaning: Dental benefits for teeth cleaning are covered in the same manner as other dental benefits and are limited to one treatment in any period of six (6) consecutive months.\n\nExclusions: There are specific exclusions which are not covered, including services incurred before eligibility, charges related to congenital malformations unless after 36 consecutive months of eligibility, treatments for cosmetic purposes, and charges for orthodontic services.\n\nPrescription Drug Benefits:\n\nCoverage: The plan covers 75% of the charge for prescription drugs, up to the maximum benefit specified in the Schedule of Benefits.\n\nPrescription Drug: Defined as a drug available to the public only upon prescription written by a licensed Physician or Health Care Provider.\n\nPrescription: A written order for dispensing and administering drugs signed by a Physician or licensed Health Care Provider.\n\nBirth Control: Benefits for prescription birth control are payable to female Employees or wives of male Employees.\n\nExclusions: Certain medications and scenarios are excluded from coverage, such as medications withdrawn from the market, non-prescription drugs, and drugs used for cosmetic purposes.\n\nTo understand the exact deductible amounts, coverage limits, and any copays for specific dental procedures and prescription drugs, you should refer to your Schedule of Benefits. This document will detail the exact financial responsibilities based on your contribution rate and class level, as well as the specifics of the coverage for dental and prescription drug benefits.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_009": "Based on the context provided from your plan document, here are the steps to take for an appeal and the associated timelines:\n\nNotice of Denial: If your claim is denied, you will receive a written notice with the details of the claim, reasons for denial, plan provisions cited, and any additional material or information required to perfect your claim.\n\nFiling an Appeal: You have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination. You must file your appeal within 180 calendar days after receiving the denial notice.\n\nSupporting Information: You can submit written comments, documents, records, and any other information you believe supports your claim.\n\nReview Process: The Claims Administrator will review all submitted information, regardless of whether it was considered in the initial decision.\n\nIndependent Reviewer: The appeal will be conducted by an individual who is not subordinate to any person who made the initial decision, and who did not participate in the initial decision if the denial was based in whole or part on medical judgment.\n\nTimeline for a Decision:\n\nFor pre-service claims (claims for benefits that require approval before receiving medical care): The plan will provide a decision within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances but no later than 30 days after receipt of the appeal.\nFor post-service claims (claims for benefits after services are provided): The plan will provide a decision on the appeal no later than 60 days after receipt of the appeal.\nUrgent Care Claims: Expedited appeal procedures are available for claims involving urgent care. The Claims Administrator must notify you of their decision as soon as possible, considering medical exigencies, but no later than 72 hours after receipt of the appeal.\n\nExternal Review: If your internal appeal is not resolved in your favor, you can request an independent external review within four (4) months of the notice of the final internal adverse determination.\n\nExpedited External Review: This can be requested for urgent care claims without completing the internal appeal process or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited internal appeal.\n\nFinal Decision: The Claims Administrator will notify you of the final decision after the internal appeal process and provide the rationale if the decision is adverse.\n\nTimeline for External Review: For non-urgent care claims, the external review decision must be provided no later than 45 days after the external review is requested.\n\nLegal Action: If your appeal results in an adverse benefit determination, you have the right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.\n\nRequirement to Appeal Before Lawsuit: You must complete the internal appeal process before you can file a lawsuit regarding the benefit decision.\n",

        "ITPEU_SPD_011": "Since you are currently on your 11th week of maternity leave and you want to extend your leave, here's how you can stay covered:\n\nFMLA Leave: You have been utilizing the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave, which entitles eligible employees to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth and care of a child. Since you're in the 11th week, you have 1 more week of FMLA leave available.\n\nExtension of Benefits: After exhausting the 12 weeks provided by FMLA, you are entitled to an extension of benefits from your Plan for a period of two months from the date of your last contribution period. This extension is in addition to the FMLA leave, provided specifically for your own disability related to childbirth.\n\nApplication for Continuation: You do not need to apply for Continuation of Coverage under Section 15 of your Plan during the FMLA leave and the subsequent two-month extension.\n\nAfter FMLA and Extension: Once you have exhausted both the FMLA leave and the two-month extension, if you wish to continue your leave and maintain health coverage, you will need to apply for Continuation of Coverage as outlined in Section 15 of the Plan.\n\nIn summary, after your FMLA leave ends following the 12th week, you can extend your health benefits for an additional two months as part of the plan's provision. Should you need more time beyond this, you would apply for Continuation of Coverage according to the guidelines of your plan.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_012": "Based on the document you provided, your spouse would not be considered a covered family member under your health plan if you have been living apart for a year or more.

        "ITPEU_SPD_013": "To list a beneficiary for your plan, the document outlines a specific process that you should follow:\n\nForm of Designation of Beneficiary: Your designation of a beneficiary must be in writing on a form supplied for this purpose by the Trustees. It's important that you use the official form to ensure that your designation is valid.\nFiling the Form: Once you have completed the beneficiary designation form, it must be on file at the principal office of the Fund to be considered valid.\nChange of Beneficiary: If you wish to change your beneficiary in the future, you can do so by completing and filing a new beneficiary form at the principal office of the Fund. This new designation will replace any previous designations.\nHere's what you might consider doing next:\n\nContact the plan administrator or visit the office where your plan is managed to request a beneficiary designation form.\nFill out the form as instructed, clearly indicating the beneficiary or beneficiaries you wish to designate.\nSubmit the completed form to the required office to ensure it is on file.\nThis process will officially record your choice of beneficiary for your plan benefits.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_014": "Based on your regular work hours of 40 hours per week, you fall into the highest classification for benefit levels according to the document.

This level typically provides the highest level of benefits available under the plan. While the document does not specify the exact benefits for each level in the sections provided, Level IV generally includes comprehensive coverage, which may encompass health, dental, vision, and possibly additional benefits like accidental death and dismemberment insurance.\n\nTo understand the specific benefits you are entitled to under Level IV, you would need to look at the detailed Schedule of Benefits provided by your plan. This schedule will outline the specifics of what is covered, including the extent of coverage for medical services, prescriptions, and other health-related expenses.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_015": "Death benefits under your plan are calculated and distributed according to several key provisions:\n\nEmployee Death (Section 5.01): If an employee dies from any cause during a period of their eligibility or within 31 days after their eligibility ends, the plan will pay the death benefit amount to the designated beneficiary as specified in the Schedule of Benefits.\nContinuation During Disability (Section 5.02): If an employee becomes totally and permanently disabled while eligible, their death benefit eligibility continues for two years or a period equal to their service with their employer (whichever is less), without further contributions.\nDeath of a Covered Family Member (Section 5.03): If a covered family member dies while the employee is eligible for benefits, the employee will receive the full amount specified in the Schedule of Benefits.\nSingle Employee’s Additional Benefit (Section 5.04): If an employee who is single dies while eligible for benefits, an additional $1,000.00 is added to the death benefit amount provided in the Schedule of Benefits.\nNon-Occupational Accidental Death and Dismemberment (Section 6): If an employee suffers dismemberment or dies due to a covered accident while eligible, the fund pays benefits as described in Section 6.02, which outlines specific amounts for dismemberment or accidental death, according to the Schedule of Benefits.\nSurvivor Death Benefits (Section 7.01): In addition to the death benefits described above, the fund pays a Survivor Death Benefit in monthly installments as outlined in the Schedule of Benefits.\nTo determine the exact amount for each of these benefits, you would refer to the Schedule of Benefits.

        "ITPEU_SPD_020": "Based on the exclusions listed in Section 23 of your plan, nova pens, which are typically used for the administration of insulin, are specifically excluded from coverage. Item 15 under the exclusions states that \"blood/injection related items: blood pressure cuffs, centrifuges, nova pens, needle-less injectors\" are not covered. This means that if you require a nova pen for diabetes management, you would need to seek alternative coverage options or discuss other possible solutions with your healthcare provider or the Claims Administrator.\n",

        "ITPEU_SPD_025": "To ensure you remain covered for an organ transplant, you need to follow the pre-certification requirements set forth by your plan. All transplant procedures must be pre-certified to confirm they are medically appropriate based on criteria established by the plan. This means you should work with your healthcare provider to get the necessary approval from your plan before proceeding with the transplant .\n\nAs for leave, if you're unable to work due to your medical condition, you might qualify for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for serious health conditions that make them unable to perform their job. Additionally, if you are undergoing treatment for your own disability, you might be entitled to an extension of benefits from the plan for a period of two months from the date of your last contribution period after utilizing any period of leave covered by the FMLA .\n\nTo maintain coverage during your leave, you might be able to make self-payments to continue your benefits. This is sometimes referred to as COBRA continuation coverage, which allows you to keep your group health insurance coverage under certain circumstances such as job loss or reduction in hours worked, among others .\n\nIf your situation is urgent and requires immediate attention, the plan provides for expedited appeal processes for urgent care claims, which would be relevant if you're dealing with an immediate need for a transplant and associated services .\n",

This means regardless of how many family members incur medical expenses, only two deductibles need to be paid in total for the family each year.\nDental Benefits: Each person covered by the plan must pay the deductible for dental expenses each calendar year. This implies that each family member would be responsible for their own dental deductible.\nTherefore, for medical expenses, your family would pay up to two deductibles in total for the year, regardless of how many of you incur expenses. For dental expenses, each family member would need to meet their individual deductible.\n",
