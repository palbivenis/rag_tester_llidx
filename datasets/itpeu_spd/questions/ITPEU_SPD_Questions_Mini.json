        "ITPEU_SPD_001": "Yes, your 28-year-old daughter is covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan if she is incapable of self-support because of a physical and/or developmental disability, and she depends on you for support. To maintain her eligibility as a covered family member, it's required that her incapacity began before she reached the age of 26 years. Additionally, you might need to provide proof of her incapacity to the Board of Trustees no later than 31 days after she reached the age limit, and proof of the continued existence of such incapacity may be required by the Board of Trustees from time to time​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_002": "Yes, treatment for lymphoma is covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan. Specifically, autologous (self-donor) bone marrow transplants with high doses of chemotherapy are considered eligible for coverage on a prior approval basis for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, intermediate or high grade Stage III or IVB, among other conditions. This includes, but is not limited to, medically appropriate transplants of certain organs or tissues and related medical expenses, as long as they meet the criteria established by the Plan.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_003": "Yes, flu vaccines are covered under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan. The plan pays 100% of the cost for \"Preventive Health Services\" required by the Affordable Care Act when such services are provided by Network Healthcare Providers. This includes immunizations for influenza (flu) for both children and adults as part of the preventive care services covered by the plan​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_004": "The ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan explicitly states that dialysis treatment is not included as a Covered Service under Home Health Care Services. Therefore, home dialysis treatment is not covered by your plan as per the exclusion list provided in the document. Additionally, the purchase or rental of dialysis equipment is also excluded from coverage​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_005": "If your work schedule is reduced in a way that lowers your Benefit Classification Level under the ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan (for example, from Level IV to Level III due to a decrease from 35 to 25 hours per week), you and your covered family members have the option, at your own expense, to maintain your medical, vision, dental, and prescription drug benefits at the level you had before the change in your work hours. This allows you to continue receiving the same level of benefits despite the reduction in hours, provided you pay the necessary contributions to maintain that level of coverage​.\n",
        "ITPEU_SPD_006": "The ITPEU Health and Welfare Plan explicitly excludes treatment for Mental Health Disorders from its coverage, as indicated in Section 23, \"General Exclusions and Limitations\" of the Plan Document. Therefore, any charges for the treatment of a Mental Health Disorder are not covered under this plan​.\n"
