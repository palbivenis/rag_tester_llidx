The coverage includes a minimum required level and options to select higher amounts of coverage based on the employee's needs and preferences. It provides financial protection to beneficiaries in the event of the employee's death.\n\n### Dental Insurance\n- **Dental Plans** are designed to cover a wide range of dental services, including preventive care, basic services, and major services. ACME offers choices between different dental plans, each with its specific coverage details, including coverage for orthodontic services under certain conditions. The plan emphasizes the importance of dental health by covering a portion of the costs associated with dental care.\n\n### Vision Insurance\n- **Vision Plans** provide benefits for eye care, including exams, glasses, and contact lenses. There are options available that allow for glasses or contacts coverage once or twice every calendar year, depending on the plan selected.

The document specifies that experiencing a Qualified Family Status Change (FSC), such as marriage, divorce, or annulment, allows you to make changes to your benefits elections outside of the Open Enrollment period. Annulment qualifies as a change in your marital status, which is a recognized FSC.\n\nTo remove your spouse from your life insurance following an annulment, you must:\n- Report the annulment to ACME US Benefits.\n- Make the desired changes to your benefits within 62 days of the annulment's finalization.\n\nThis procedure ensures that benefits changes are consistent with the FSC event, allowing for the adjustment of coverage in accordance with your current marital status.

Flexible Benefit Plan outlines specific procedures for continuity of care in such situations. Here’s what happens to your coverage:\n\n- **Continuity of Care**: If you are currently receiving treatment from a provider whose network status changes (from network to non-network) during your treatment, you may be eligible to request continued care from your current provider at the network benefit level for certain medical conditions and timeframes.\n- **Conditions Covered**: This provision applies to situations like an acute condition, a serious chronic condition, a high-risk pregnancy (or second or third trimester of pregnancy), or if you're undergoing treatment for a terminal illness. \n- **Duration of Continuation**: Treatment by the terminated provider may continue up to 90 days for an acute condition or serious chronic condition. For a high-risk pregnancy or during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, treatment may continue until postpartum care related to the delivery is completed.\n- **Special Considerations**: Treatment may continue for a longer period if necessary for a safe transfer to another provider, as determined through consultation with the provider and authorized by UnitedHealthcare.\n\nIt's important to contact UnitedHealthcare directly to discuss your specific situation and to understand how to proceed with continuity of care under these provisions.
