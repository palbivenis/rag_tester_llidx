        "ACME_UTD_SPD_010": "Yes, you can cover your disabled daughter who is 30 years old under the ACME America Inc. Flexible Benefit Plan. The document specifies that your child may continue coverage beyond age 26 if he or she is disabled. The plan includes provisions for disabled dependent children, allowing them to remain eligible for medical, dental, vision, and life insurance coverage under certain conditions:\n\n- The child becomes permanently and totally disabled prior to age 26.\n- Medical certification confirms the child is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to a physical handicap or mental impairment.\n- The child lives with you more than 50% of the plan year.\n- The child is not able to provide more than 50% of his or her own support.\n- Coverage will continue as long as the enrolled dependent is medically certified as disabled and dependent unless coverage is otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of the plan.\n- The plan may ask you to furnish proof of the medical certification of disability within 31 days of the date coverage would otherwise have ended because the child reached a certain age.\n\nThis provision ensures that disabled dependents who meet these criteria can maintain their coverage even after the typical age limit for dependents. You should consult with your benefits administrator or refer to your plan documents to understand the specific process for certifying your daughter's disability status and to ensure continued coverage\n",
        "ACME_UTD_SPD_013": "Yes, if your marriage annulment has been finalized, you can make changes to your life insurance, such as removing your former spouse from your coverage. The document specifies that experiencing a Qualified Family Status Change (FSC), such as marriage, divorce, or annulment, allows you to make changes to your benefits elections outside of the Open Enrollment period. Annulment qualifies as a change in your marital status, which is a recognized FSC.\n\nTo remove your spouse from your life insurance following an annulment, you must:\n- Report the annulment to ACME US Benefits.\n- Make the desired changes to your benefits within 62 days of the annulment's finalization.\n\nThis procedure ensures that benefits changes are consistent with the FSC event, allowing for the adjustment of coverage in accordance with your current marital status. Remember, the effective date of the benefits changes you submit may vary but will generally align with either the date of the FSC or the date your election is submitted\n",
        "ACME_UTD_SPD_029": "Yes, root canal therapy is covered under the ACME America, Inc. Flexible Benefit Plan.

        "ACME_UTD_SPD_058": "Thermometers are specifically listed under the category of items that are not eligible for coverage under the Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) section of the ACME UnitedHealthcare Medical Plans.
