For instance, if You \nrequest a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, \nYou may file suit in a Federal court. In such a ca se, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the \nmaterials and pay You up to $110 a day until You receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because \nof reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If You have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in \nwhole or in part, You may file suit in a state or Federal court after You have exhausted all steps in the procedures for \nfiling claims and appeals. In addition, if You disagree with the Plans decision or lack the reof concerning the qualified \nstatus of a domestic relations order or a medical Child support order, You may file suit in Federal court after all \nrequired reviews of Your claim have been completed. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan s \nmoney, or if You are discriminated against for asserting Your rights, You may seek assistance from the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, or You may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and \nlegal fees. If You are successf ul, the court may order the person You have sued to pay these costs and fees. If You \nlose, the court may order You to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds Your claim is frivolous. \n \nAssistance With Your Questions \nIf You have any questions about Your Plan, You should contact the Plan Administrator. If You have any questions \nabout this statement or about Your rights under ERISA, or if You need assistance in obtaining documents from the \nPlan Administrator, You should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, United \nStates Department of Labor listed in Your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, \nEmployee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. \n2024 ACME America, Inc. Flexible Benefit Plan Document and SPD 177 \n \n \nDepartment of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain \npublications about Your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publication hotline of the Employee \nBenefit Security Administration. \n \nNewborn and Mothers Health Protection Act \nUnder Federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage \ngenerally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with Childbirth for the mother or \nnewborn Child to less than 48 ho urs following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by \ncesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending Provider (e.g., Your \nphysician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consulta tion with the mother, discharges the mother or \nnewborn earlier. \n \nAlso, under Federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of benefits or Out-of-Pocket costs so that any later \nportion of the 48hour (or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any \nearlier portion of the sta y. \n \nIn addition, a plan or issuer may not, under Federal law, require that a Physician or other health care Provider obtain \nauthorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain Providers or \nfacilities, or to r educe Your Outof-Pocket costs, You may be required to obtain notification or notify \nUnitedHealthcare. For information, contact UnitedHealthcare. \n \nWomens Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) \nFor any participant or beneficiary of the Plan who currently is receiving Plan benefits for a mastectomy, the Plan will \nprovide coverage for any necessary surgery and reconstruction of the breast on which a mastectomy was not \nperformed in order to produce a symmetrical appearance. \n \nThis coverage will be subject to the same Deductibles and Copayments that apply to mastectomies under the Plans \ncurrent terms. \nFor information on coverage under the UnitedHealthcare Plans, see information provided elsewhere in this Plan \ndocument and Summary Plan Description (SPD) for details on the applicable Deductible and Copayment \nrequirements for mastectomies. If You are enrol led in a Kaiser Permanente HMO plan, please consult the Evidence \nof Coverage provided by the specific plan. \n \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) \nGenetic information is Protected Health Information. In accordance with the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination \nAct, the Plan will not use or disclose genetic information for underwriting purposes, which include eligibility \ndeterminations, premium comput ations, applications of any pre-existing condition Exclusions, and any other \nactivities related to the creation, renewal, or replacement of a contract of health insurance or health benefits. \n## This document is contained under the following sections:\nLegal and Administrative Information\n## Documents at the same level as this document:\nNAME AND ADDRESS OF EMPLOYER\nADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nAGENT FOR SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS\n"},{"title":"FULL & PART TIME EMPLOYEES","snippet":"## Relevant Document Title:\nFULL & PART TIME EMPLOYEES\n## Document Text:\n\n \nFULL & PART TIME EMPLOYEES \nYou may participate in one of the medical, dental, vision, life\/accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D), long \nterm disability (LTD), and health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSA) benefits offered under \nthe Plan when You meet one of the eligibility requirements listed below. \n- Regular Full-Time Employee on the ACME U.S. payroll scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week \n- Regular Part-Time Employee on the ACME U.S. payroll scheduled to work 20-29 hours per week \nInterns and temporary Employees are not eligible to participate in the Plan as they are not regular Employees \nof ACME .

For a high-risk pregnancy or during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, treatment may continue until postpartum care related to the delivery is completed.\n- **Special Considerations**: Treatment may continue for a longer period if necessary for a safe transfer to another provider, as determined through consultation with the provider and authorized by UnitedHealthcare.\n\nIt's important to contact UnitedHealthcare directly to discuss your specific situation and to understand how to proceed with continuity of care under these provisions.

ACME allows participants to carry over up to $610 for 2023 and \n$640 for 2024 of Your unspent Health Care FSA contributions to the next Calendar Year so long as You are enrolled \nin the Health Care FSA COBRA coverage at the end of the Calendar Year. However, add itional FSA contributions \nmay not be made and reimbursement of any qualified expense(s) is limited to the applicable COBRA period. The \ncarryover provision does NOT apply to the Dependent Care Account. \n \nUnless otherwise elected, all qualified beneficiaries who were covered under the Health Care FSA will be covered \ntogether for Health Care FSA COBRA coverage. However, each qualified beneficiary could alternatively elect \nseparate COBRA coverage to cover tha t beneficiary only, with a separate Health Care FSA annual limit and a \nseparate premium. If You are interested in this alternative, contact ACME s COBRA Administrator for more \ninformation. \n \nMore Information about Individuals Who May Be COBRA Qualified Beneficiaries \n Children born to or placed for adoption with the covered Employee during COBRA coverage period \n A Child born to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with a covered Employee during a period of \nCOBRA coverage is considered a qualified beneficiary if, the covered Employee is a qualified \nbeneficiary, and the covered Employee has elected COBRA coverage for himself or herself. The \nChilds COBRA coverage begins when the Child is enrolled in the Plan, whether through special \nenrollment or open enrollment, and it lasts for as long as COBRA coverage lasts for other family \nmembers of the Employee. To be enrolled in the Plan, the Child must satisfy the otherwise applicable \nPlan eligibility requirements (for example, regarding age). \n Alternate recipients under QMCSOs \n A Child of the covered Employee who is receiving benefits under the Plan pursuant to a Qualified \nMedical Child Support Order (QMCSO) received during the covered Employees period of \nemployment with ACME is entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA coverage as an eligible \ndependent Child of the covered Employee, regardless of whether that Child would otherwise be \nconsidered a dependent. \n \nIf You Have Questions \nQuestions concerning Your Plan or Your COBRA rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified \nbelow.
