The document provides detailed criteria for what constitutes a qualified domestic partner, including aspects like sharing the same principal residence, being mutually responsible for each other's common welfare, and not being legally married to someone else.\n\nIf your partner meets the criteria outlined for a qualified domestic partner or if you are legally married, you may be able to enroll them in the life insurance coverage offered under the plan, subject to the plan's terms and conditions.
